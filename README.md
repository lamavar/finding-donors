## Project: Finding Donors for CharityML

In this project, we use supervised learning techniques with the help of sklearn on data collected for the U.S. census to help a fictitious charity organisation identify people most likely to donate to their cause.

The first step consists of preprocessing the data - transforming the skewed features, normalising numerical features and one-hot encoding categorical (non-numeric) variables.

We then select the relevant metrics to assess our models - accuracy, precision, recall and f-beta score. The data set is split into a training and test sets.

Various supervised learning models are evaluated and then we use a training and prediction pipeline to evaluate the metrics (score) and speed/efficiency of three of the most suitable algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random forest and AdaBoost).

We then proceed to fine tune the parameters of the algorithm that gives the highest score (predicting the donors most likely to donate). This would help the charity maximise donations and minimise effort and costs. We also study feature importance and explore the impact of reducing the number of features in the dataset.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

We recommend students install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `finding_donors.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `visuals.py` Python file and the `census.csv` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in `visuals.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `finding_donors/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The modified census dataset consists of approximately 32,000 data points, with each datapoint having 13 features. This dataset is a modified version of the dataset published in the paper *"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: a Decision-Tree Hybrid",* by Ron Kohavi. You may find this paper [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf), with the original dataset hosted on [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
